System Requirement
==================


* This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows
  Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. Both
  32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. Windows 98/ME is not supported.



Known Issues
============


* In order to disable/enable USB items on x64 systems, you also must
  use the x64 version of USBDeview.
* The 'Created Date' column doesn't display correct values on Windows
  7/8/Vista/2008.
* Some USB devices with bad driver may cause USBDeview to hang. In
  order to bypass this problem, you should turn off the 'Retrieve USB
  Power/Version Information' option:
  USBDeview.exe /RetrieveUSBPower 0



Versions History
================


* Version 3.00
  o Added 4 new columns: Install Time, First Install Time, Connect
    Time, Disconnect Time.
  o You can view the new fields only when you run USBDeview as

'Vendor Name' And 'Product Name' Columns
========================================

Starting from version 1.35, you can view the vendor name and product name
of your USB devices. In order to use this feature, you have to download
the USB ID's list of Stephen J. Gowdy (http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids)
and put the file in the same folder of USBDeview.exe
The name of the file must remain as 'usb.ids'.



Speed Test for USB Flash Drives
===============================

Starting from version 1.40, USBDeview allows you to test the read/write
speed of your USB flash drive. The test is made by writing a large file
(named $speed_test_nirsoft$.dat) into your USB flash drive, and then
reading it back for testing the read speed. Be aware that you need at
least 100 MB of free disk space in order to successfully make this speed
test. Also, be aware that this test is made with sequential read and
write operations. When using multiple small files, the read/write
performances are usually much lower than sequential read/write.

In order to make a speed test to your flash drive, simply select the
desired item in the main window, and then choose the 'Speed Test' option
from the File menu, or press Ctrl+T. In the speed test window, verify
that the selected drive letter is the right one, and then press the
'Start Test' button. Wait a few seconds until the write and read tests
are finished.



Publishing Your Speed Test Result
=================================

If you want to share your speed test results, so other people that want
to purchase a USB flash drive will be able to easily compare the speed of
different flash drives, you can use the 'Publish Test Result' option to
do that.

When you successfully finish a speed test, the 'Publish Test Result'
button is automatically enabled. Clicking this button opens a new window
that displays all the data that will be sent to
http://usbspeed.nirsoft.net Web site, and ask you the confirm the speed
test publishing. Be aware that only the data displayed in this window is
transmitted to http://usbspeed.nirsoft.net Web site. USBDeview doesn't
send the serial number of your USB device or any other information that
may violate your privacy.



AutoPlay
========

Starting from version 1.10, USBDeview allows you to automatically run a
file on USB flash memory devices, according to AutoRun.inf filename. You
can manually activate the AutoPlay feature by selecting the desired
device and pressing F8. Alternatively, You can check the "AutoPlay When
Device Is Connected" option, and then the AutoPlay feature will be
automatically activated when you insert a USB flash memory device.
Be aware that this feature only works if USBDeview detects the drive
letter of the device.



Execute a command when you insert a USB device
==============================================

Starting from version 1.10, USBDeview allows you to execute a command
from exe/cmd/bat file in every time that insert a USB device to your
system. In order to use this feature, go to 'Options->Advanced Options',
select the 'Execute..' check-box, and type the exe/cmd file that you want
to run. You can also use the following special variables in this command
string: %device_name%, %device_desc%, %drive%, %serial_number%, %vid%,
%pid%, %vid_hex%, %pid_hex% , %device_type%, %service_name%,
%device_class%, %device_mfg%
USBDeview will automatically replace these variables with the appropriate
data of the device that you inserted. For example, if you want to pass to
your exe file 2 parameters - the serial number of the device, and the
drive letter:
c:\temp\test.exe "%serial_number%" "%drive%"



Known Limitations/Issues
========================


* For all devices except 'Mass Storage' Devices: If you plug a device
  to one USB port, and then you plug the same device to another USB port,
  a new record of the same device will be created for each USB port that
  you plug. So if you see multiple lines for exactly the same device, it
  means that you plugged it to different USB ports. The USB ports that
  you plugged are specified in 'Hub/Port' column.
  However, for 'Mass Storage' device, only one record is created for each
  device, even if you plug it to different USB port.
* When a USB device is added/removed on your local computer, UDBDeview
  utility automatically updates the list of USB devices.
  But... If you UDBDeview is connected to a remote computer, the list
  won't refresh automatically when a device is added or removed. You must
  refresh it manually, by pressing F5 key.



Connecting To Remote Computer
=============================

The following command-line options allows you to connect to remote
computers. You must login to the remote computer with admin user in order
to use these options.
* /remote <\\Computer Name>
  Allows you to connect a single remote computer.
  For Example:
  USBDeview.exe /remote \\MyComp
* /remotefile <Computers List File>
  Allows you to connect multiple computers, and view all their USB
  activity in one window. The computers list file should be a simple
  Ascii text file with computer names separated by colon, semicolon,
  space, tab characters or CRLF.
  For Example:
  USBDeview.exe /remotefile "c:\temp\comp.txt"
In order to successfully get full admin access to the remote computer,
read this Blog post: How to connect a remote Windows 7/Vista/XP computer
with NirSoft utilities.



Connecting To external SYSTEM registry file
===========================================

If you have the 'SYSTEM' registry file of external operating system, you
can use the following command-line option to read the USB devices list
from it:
/regfile <SYSTEM Registry File>

For Example:
USBDeview.exe /regfile "c:\temp\regfiles\SYSTEM"
USBDeview.exe /regfile "d:\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM"

This option has some limitations:
* You cannot read a Registry file of Windows XP/2003/Vista from Windows
  2000 Machine.
* USBDeview works in read-only mode. (You cannot uninstall a device
  from external file)



Stop/Disconnect Command-Line Options
====================================


* /stop {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Name>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying its name or description.
  You don't have to specify the whole name or description. You can also
  specify only a part of the name or description string, and USBDeview
  will identify it. For example, If the device name is 'Kingston
  DataTraveler 2.0', you can simply put 'kingston' or 'DataTraveler' in
  the device name parameter, and USBDeview will disconnect the right
  device. You can also specify the instance ID string of the device.
  If you want that a message/balloon will be displayed after the device
  is disconnected, add the '/showmsg' parameter. (Windows 2000 displays a
  message-box, Windows XP displays a balloon)
  If you want to disconnect a device in a remote computer, specify the
  remote computer name, with \\ prefix. You must login to the remote
  computer with admin rights in order to do that.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop /showmsg "DVD RW"
  USBDeview.exe /stop "DataTraveler"
  USBDeview.exe /stop \\comp01 "SanDisk Cruzer"
  USBDeview.exe /stop "USB\Vid_1058&Pid_1023\8539583490834690"


* /stop_by_serial {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Serial>
  Similar to /stop command, but instead of specifying a device name, you
  should specify the serial number of the device. Works only with mass
  storage devices.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_serial ea051261
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_serial /showmsg 876534513


* /stop_by_drive {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Drive Letter>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying its drive letter. Works only
  with USB flash drives and CD/DVD devices.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive g:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive /showmsg f:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive /showmsg \\comp02 t:


* /stop_by_class {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <USB Class;USB
  SubClass;USB Protocol>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying the class/subclass/protocol
  combination.
  For example, if you want to stop all 'Mass Storage' devices, you should
  specify the following class/subclass/protocol combination: 08;06;50
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_class /showmsg 08;06;50
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_class 03;01;02


* /stop_by_pid {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <VendorID;ProductID>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying the VendorID/ProductID. You
  can specify only the VendorID if you want to disconnect all devices
  with that VendorID.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_pid /showmsg 13fe;1a00
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_pid 04f9


* /stop_all {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer}
  Stop/disconnect all USB devices currently connected to your computer.
